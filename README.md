This is a port of the FlipClock (MAEMO) alarm-clock application to the
Zipit Z2.

It's fairly compact as a standalone app, and works pretty well as the time display for a scripted alarm clock applet.  It can also poll for status messages from a pipe, so it could be directed to display weather info (including unicode weather glyphs), or display currently playing song track info, or a ToDo list, or whatever.
